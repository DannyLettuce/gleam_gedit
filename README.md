# Gleam Gedit
File to add support to Gleam Language for the famous gedit editor ( and other GtkSourceView editors )
## Install
Copy the .lang file and add it to the language-specs folder.
Usually:

    $ ~/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ 

and restart your editor. That's it!
## Notes
This is a first attempt for supporting gleam syntax highlighting, so consider this project as a work in progress. 

PR's are welcome!
